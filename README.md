## üåç Overview and Introduction

This data management project delves into HIV trends and key indicators across **Malaysia**, **ASEAN countries**, and the **global landscape**. Utilizing comprehensive datasets from WHO and other reputable sources, the analysis offers insights into the progression of the HIV epidemic, treatment coverage, and mortality rates over time.


---

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

**Primary Data Sources:**

- World Health Organization (WHO) HIV Data: 14 Datasets

**Key Indicators Analyzed:**

- Estimated number of PLHIV  
- New HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population  
- Number of people receiving ART  
- HIV-related mortality rates  
- Percentage of HIV-positive results returned to individuals

---

## üéØ Objectives

1. To analyze temporal trends in key HIV indicators (people living with HIV, new infections, deaths, and ART coverage) in Malaysia and ASEAN countries from 2000 to 2023.
2. To compare HIV epidemic patterns across ASEAN countries and WHO regions, highlighting disparities in prevalence, ART coverage, and mortality.
3. To assess gender differences in new HIV infection rates and evaluate the impact of ART coverage on HIV-related deaths. 
4. To analyze HIV-related indicators among children and pregnant women, including ART coverage, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and treatment outcomes.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

**Steps Undertaken:**

- Handled missing values through imputation or exclusion, as appropriate.  
- Standardized country and indicator names for consistency.  
- Converted data types to ensure accurate computations.  
- Merged datasets from multiple sources to create a unified analytical framework.

## üß© Key Challenges

- Data discrepancies across different countries and years.  
- Incomplete datasets requiring careful handling of missing values.  
- Variations in data reporting standards among countries.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

- Significant progress has been made in increasing ART coverage, leading to reductions in AIDS-related deaths.  
- However, disparities persist among ASEAN countries, necessitating targeted interventions.  
- Continuous monitoring and data-driven policies are essential to combat the HIV epidemic effectively.
