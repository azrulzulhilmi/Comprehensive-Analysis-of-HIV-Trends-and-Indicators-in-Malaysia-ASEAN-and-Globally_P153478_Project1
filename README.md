## 🌍 Overview and Introduction

This data science project analyzes HIV/AIDS epidemiological data across **Malaysia**, the **ASEAN region**, and **globally**. It explores patterns in transmission, prevalence, and policy response using multiple public health datasets.

Key goals include:
- Understanding the progression of HIV/AIDS cases over time.
- Identifying key populations at risk.
- Evaluating the impact of healthcare access and interventions.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

Key data sources and features:

- 🧬 **Epidemiological Metrics**: New HIV infections, AIDS cases, AIDS-related deaths  
- 👥 **Demographics**: Age, gender, risk groups (e.g., MSM, PWID, FSW, TG)  
- 🏥 **Healthcare Access**: ART coverage, testing rates, treatment success  
- 🌐 **Geographic Scope**: Malaysia-focused, with ASEAN and global comparisons

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Track HIV case and death trends over the past two decades.
- Compare country-level ART coverage and prevention effectiveness.
- Visualize the concentration of cases among key populations.
- Support data-driven health policy decisions.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps taken:
- ✔ Merged and standardized multiple sources (UNAIDS, WHO, national reports)
- ✔ Filled missing values with interpolation or mean substitution
- ✔ Created derived indicators:
  - **ART Coverage Rate**
  - **Death-to-Case Ratio**
  - **Infection Rate by Key Population**

---

## 📈 Analysis & Visualizations

Visual insights include:

### 📌 Time Series Trends

> ![Placeholder for trend](images/hiv_trend_plot.png)  
Malaysia shows a transition from injection-driven transmission to sexual transmission since the 2010s.

---

### 📌 Key Populations by Country

> ![Key population bar chart](images/key_populations.png)  
High infection rates among MSM and PWID, especially in Malaysia and Thailand.

---

### 📌 ART Coverage vs Death Rates

> ![ART impact plot](images/art_vs_death.png)  
Countries with higher ART coverage show a steady decline in AIDS-related deaths.

---

## 🧩 Key Challenges

- 📊 Limited or inconsistent data from some ASEAN countries
- 🌍 Standardizing global vs regional metrics
- 🔍 Lack of granular age/gender breakdown in older records

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- **Key populations** remain disproportionately affected.
- **Malaysia** has improved ART coverage, but prevention among MSM and PWID needs scaling.
- **Global disparity** persists — Sub-Saharan Africa bears the heaviest burden.
- **Data** is essential for targeted intervention and public health planning.
