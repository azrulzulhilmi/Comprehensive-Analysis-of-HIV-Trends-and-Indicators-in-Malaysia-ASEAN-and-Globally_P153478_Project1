## 🌍 Overview and Introduction

This data science project delves into HIV/AIDS trends and key indicators across **Malaysia**, **ASEAN countries**, and the **global landscape**. Utilizing comprehensive datasets from UNAIDS and other reputable sources, the analysis offers insights into the progression of the HIV epidemic, treatment coverage, and mortality rates over time.

**Key Objectives:**

- Analyze temporal trends in HIV prevalence, new infections, and AIDS-related deaths.
- Assess antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among people living with HIV (PLHIV).
- Compare regional disparities and identify areas requiring targeted interventions.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

**Primary Data Sources:**

- UNAIDS Global HIV & AIDS Statistics  
- World Health Organization (WHO) HIV/AIDS Data  

**Key Indicators Analyzed:**

- Estimated number of PLHIV  
- New HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population  
- Number of people receiving ART  
- AIDS-related mortality rates  
- Percentage of HIV-positive results returned to individuals

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To examine the trends in HIV/AIDS indicators over time across Malaysia, ASEAN, and globally.  
- To evaluate the effectiveness of ART programs and their impact on mortality rates.  
- To identify regional disparities and recommend areas for policy intervention.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

**Steps Undertaken:**

- Handled missing values through imputation or exclusion, as appropriate.  
- Standardized country and indicator names for consistency.  
- Converted data types to ensure accurate computations.  
- Merged datasets from multiple sources to create a unified analytical framework.

## 🧩 Key Challenges

- Data discrepancies across different countries and years.  
- Incomplete datasets requiring careful handling of missing values.  
- Variations in data reporting standards among countries.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- Significant progress has been made in increasing ART coverage, leading to reductions in AIDS-related deaths.  
- However, disparities persist among ASEAN countries, necessitating targeted interventions.  
- Continuous monitoring and data-driven policies are essential to combat the HIV epidemic effectively.
